# 🚀 GitHub Pages Quick Setup Guide

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open your GitHub repository page: `https://github.com/mobaibai/template-react-vite`

2. Click the **Settings** tab at the top of the repository

3. Scroll down in the left sidebar menu and find the **Pages** option

4. In the **Source** section:
   - Select **GitHub Actions** (not Deploy from a branch)

5. Click **Save** to save the settings

## Step 2: Check Deployment Status

1. Go back to the repository homepage and click the **Actions** tab

2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running or completed

3. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually takes 2-5 minutes)

## Step 3: Access Your Website

After deployment is complete, your website will be available at:

```
https://mobaibai.github.io/template-react-vite/
```

## 🎉 Done!

Now every time you push code to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your website.

## 📝 Notes

- First deployment may take a few minutes
- If you encounter issues, check the error logs in the Actions page
- For more detailed information, please refer to the `DEPLOY.md` file
